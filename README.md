The Problem Statement 
Create a intelligent Script Breakdown Tool that automatically categorizes and organized script elements including characters, props ,locations,wardrobes and scheduling requirements to streamline the pre-production Plan (Similar to StudioBinder)

Product Name: Cinecon.Ally
The Idea: Cinicon.Ally is a Simple AI Powered ScreenPlay Breakdown and Edit tool built by the Team Cinicon Alley. The Purpose of this Product is to provide the user with a Preproduction/Writing Tool in which they can upload their screenplays and Breakdown the Script into its core elements such as "Scenes"  , "Characters", "Props", "Wardrobe", "Location & Time"

The above elements will be displayed in a clean and tabulated form which the user can download as a CSV File.
The Product also features 2 additional Tools to showcase the Potential the system has for the future.

1. Simple Budget Estimation
   The Application is able to estimate and predict the budget of the Production. It is done by setting an average value to few feilds such as cast, crew, Art , etc. Then the estimated budget will be deduced by simple mathematical calculations.
   For the Future Version we can build a custom Machine Learning Model Trained on the dataset of the Preproduction Workflow of the Industry. This will help calculate and predict a More accurate Result.

2. Character Based Screen Space Ratio
   The Application also features a basic Pi Chart which will showcase the ScreenSpace of Each character so that its easier for the Preproduction Team to Improvise and make changes accordingly.

Future Potentials:
Cinicon.Ally can be a fully functional Pre Production tool used by writers and Production Teams to Manage their Projects. It can be made into an fully AI powered Screenplay Analysis and development tool especially useful for writers looking for softwares where they can store their Unused Ideas as Simple Notes and also write full Bound Screenplays. ( Similar to Notion, Obsidian etc)

For the Production Team , The software will be able to provide a Simple Scheduling System considering all the elements of the screenplay and which also can be overrided by the Team to make manual changes. (Similar to StudioBinder)

##  The Problem Statement

> Create an intelligent Script Breakdown Tool that automatically categorizes and organizes script elements including characters, props, locations, wardrobes, and scheduling requirements to streamline the pre-production plan (Similar to StudioBinder).

##  Our Solution: Cinecon.Ally

**Cinecon.Ally** is a simple, AI-powered screenplay breakdown and editing tool. Its core purpose is to provide writers and production teams with a tool to upload screenplays and automatically break them down into their essential elements.

The system intelligently extracts and organizes the following components into a clean, tabulated format that can be downloaded as a **CSV file**:
* Scenes
* Characters
* Props
* Wardrobe
* Location & Time



###  Additional Features

To showcase the potential of the system, we've included two additional proof-of-concept tools.

#### 1. Simple Budget Estimation ðŸ’°
The application provides a preliminary budget estimate for the production. This is achieved by assigning average industry values to key fields (e.g., cast, crew, art department). The final estimate is then derived through simple calculations based on the script's contents.

* **Future Potential**: Develop a custom Machine Learning model trained on industry pre-production data to predict budgets with much higher accuracy.

#### 2. Character-Based Screen Time Ratio ðŸ“Š
The application generates a pie chart visualizing the screen time distribution for each character. This gives the creative team a quick overview, making it easier to improvise and make necessary script changes during pre-production.



---

## ðŸš€ Future Potential

Cinicon.Ally aims to evolve into a comprehensive pre-production suite for writers and production teams. Future enhancements include:

* **All-in-One Writing & Management Tool**: Become a fully AI-powered screenplay analysis and development tool, allowing writers to store ideas, notes, and write full-bound screenplays (similar to Notion or Obsidian).
* **Intelligent Scheduling System**: Provide an automated scheduling system that considers all extracted script elements. The schedule will be fully customizable, allowing the production team to make manual overrides as needed (similar to StudioBinder).
